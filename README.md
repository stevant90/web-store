This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### Web-store

Web-store is a single page application that simulates the web-store app, in which you can pick up products and templates. The app contains two tabs, which is implemented using react-router, and the app also shows the usage of reusable components, where all data are based on props. For style sass is used, and for class names BEM is used. Two tabs are synchronized, so you can collect as many products, while on the other side you can choose just one template, and when you change tabs selected items from the previous tab will disappear.
